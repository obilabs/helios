## 🎯 Strategic Positioning

### Helios Client Portal (Current)
**Tagline**: "Modern workspace management for Google organizations"

**For**: Internal IT teams at companies using Google Workspace
**Problems Solved**:
- Manual Google Admin tasks → Automated
- User provisioning → Self-service
- Scattered tools → Unified dashboard

---

### Helios Pro (ITSM Integrated)
**Tagline**: "The only ITSM built natively for Google Workspace"

**For**: IT teams who want ITSM WITHOUT giving up workspace control
**Problems Solved**:
- Duplicate data entry (users in both systems) → Auto-synced
- Context switching (Google Admin + ITSM tool) → One platform
- Stale asset inventory → Auto-updated from Google
- Missing workspace context in tickets → Automatically linked

**Competitive Advantages**:
1. **Zero Sync Lag** - Same database, instant updates
2. **Auto-Asset Discovery** - Import from Google Workspace
3. **User Context** - Tickets know user's devices, groups, OU
4. **Modern UX** - React/TypeScript vs PHP admin panels
5. **Provider Access** - API keys with actor attribution (unique!)

**USP**: "Stop managing two systems. Helios is workspace + ITSM in one."

---

### Helios MTP (MSP Platform)
**Tagline**: "Client-sovereign IT management for modern MSPs"

**For**: MSPs who want to offer clients data ownership
**Problems Solved**:
- Vendor lock-in → Clients own their data
- Limited provider access → Granular API keys
- Expensive platforms → Open-core pricing
- Complex migrations → Built-in export/import

**Competitive Advantage vs ITFlow**:
1. **Hosted Solution** (ITFlow is self-hosted only)
2. **Modern Stack** (ITFlow is PHP/MySQL)
3. **Google Native** (ITFlow has ZERO Google integration)
4. **Better UX** (ITFlow UI is dated AdminLTE theme)
5. **API-First** (ITFlow has minimal API)

---

## 🏛️ Architecture Decision: Integrated vs Standalone

### ✅ **Decision: Build ITSM as Helios Modules**

**Why**:

**1. Technical Efficiency**
```
Existing Helios Infrastructure (Reuse 100%):
✅ canonical data model       → ITSM entities map cleanly
✅ Feature flags              → Enable/disable ITSM features
✅ API key system             → Provider access (PERFECT FIT!)
✅ User directory             → Ticket assignments, asset owners
✅ Module system              → ITSM is just another module
✅ Authentication             → Single sign-on
✅ Database (PostgreSQL)      → Add ITSM tables
✅ Testing framework          → Add ITSM tests
✅ LabelsContext              → Customize ITSM terminology

Timeline: 6-8 weeks to ITSM MVP

vs Standalone:
❌ Rebuild all of above      → 4-6 months
❌ Integration complexity     → Ongoing maintenance nightmare
```

**2. User Experience**
```
Integrated:
User logs into Helios → Sees everything
- Directory tab
- ITSM tab (Tickets, Assets, Credentials)
- Settings tab
- ONE search bar (finds users AND tickets AND assets)

Standalone:
User logs into Helios → Manages workspace
User logs into ITSM → Separate login, separate data
User creates ticket → Can't see Helios users easily
```

**3. Data Model Synergy**
```typescript
// Tickets ALREADY HAVE users!
ticket {
  id: "T-001",
  title: "Laptop not working",
  assignedTo: entity.user("mike@company.com"), // ← Already in Helios!
  relatedAsset: entity.asset("laptop-123"),
  createdBy: entity.user("jane@company.com"),  // ← Already in Helios!
  workspace: entity.workspace("Engineering"),  // ← Already defined!
}

// No synchronization needed - same database!
```

**4. Provider Access Model**
```typescript
// Your API key system ALREADY DOES THIS!

Vendor API Key for MSP Provider:
{
  key: "helios_vendor_abc123",
  permissions: [
    "read:tickets",
    "write:tickets",
    "read:assets",
    "read:users"  // Can see user info for context
  ],
  requiresActor: true // Every action shows tech name!
}

Request headers:
X-API-Key: helios_vendor_abc123
X-Actor-Name: "John Smith"
X-Actor-Email: "john@msp.com"
X-Client-Reference: "TICKET-789"

Audit log shows:
"John Smith from ObiLabs MSP created ticket T-456 for Acme Corp"
```

**Your decentralized vision IS ACHIEVABLE with integrated approach!**

---

## 🗺️ Detailed Roadmap

### **Immediate: Complete Current Work** (1 week)

**Week 1**:
1. Complete API Keys UI (Settings > Integrations)
2. Complete User Detail View
3. Polish existing features
4. Get to 100% on current scope

**Deliverable**: Helios v1.0 - Workspace Management
**Status**: Production-ready

---

### **Phase 1: Documentation Module** (2-3 weeks)

**Why First**: Lowest complexity, highest MSP need

**Entities**:
```sql
-- Documents for IT documentation
documents (
  id, organization_id, name, description,
  content_type, file_path, folder_id,
  created_by, updated_at
)

-- Folders for organization
folders (
  id, organization_id, name, parent_folder_id
)

-- Link documents to assets, users, services
document_assets (document_id, asset_id)
document_users (document_id, user_id)
```

**Features**:
- Upload/organize IT documentation
- Link docs to users, groups, assets
- Search functionality
- Version history
- Access control (internal vs client-visible)

**Integration with Helios**:
- Link docs to Google Workspace users
- Link docs to devices
- Use LabelsContext (customize "Documents" to "Runbooks")

**Value**: IT teams have centralized documentation immediately

---

### **Phase 2: Asset & Credential Management** (3-4 weeks)

**Entities**:
```sql
-- Assets (computers, phones, network gear)
assets (
  id, organization_id, name, type, make, model,
  serial_number, os, purchase_date, warranty_expiry,
  location_id, assigned_user_id, status
)

-- Credentials (passwords, API keys)
credentials (
  id, organization_id, name, username,
  password_encrypted, uri, notes,
  otp_secret, created_by, last_rotated
)

-- Linking system
asset_credentials (asset_id, credential_id)
asset_documents (asset_id, document_id)
user_assets (user_id, asset_id)
```

**Auto-Import from Google Workspace**:
```typescript
// Helios SUPERPOWER - ITFlow can't do this!
async function syncAssetsFromGoogle(orgId) {
  // Import Chrome OS devices
  const chromebooks = await google.admin.chromeosdevices.list();
  chromebooks.forEach(device => {
    db.insert('assets', {
      organization_id: orgId,
      name: device.deviceId,
      type: 'chromebook',
      serial_number: device.serialNumber,
      os: device.osVersion,
      assigned_user_id: findUser(device.annotatedUser), // ← Already in Helios!
      last_synced: NOW()
    });
  });

  // Import mobile devices
  const phones = await google.admin.mobiledevices.list();
  // ... same pattern
}
```

**Features**:
- Asset inventory (auto-synced from Google!)
- Credential vault (AES-256 encrypted)
- Link assets to users (already in system!)
- Link credentials to assets
- Warranty tracking
- Location tracking

**Value**: Asset inventory that's ALWAYS up-to-date (Google sync!)

---

### **Phase 3: Domain & Certificate Tracking** (2-3 weeks)

**Entities**:
```sql
-- Domains
domains (
  id, organization_id, name, registrar,
  expire_date, auto_renew, nameservers,
  created_at
)

-- DNS records (auto-fetched daily)
domain_dns_records (
  id, domain_id, type, name, value,
  ttl, last_checked, changed_at
)

-- Certificates
certificates (
  id, organization_id, domain_id, name,
  expire_date, issued_by, issued_to,
  status, last_checked
)

-- Linking
domain_credentials (domain_id, credential_id) -- Registrar login
domain_documents (domain_id, document_id)     -- Config docs
```

**Features (ITFlow's Most Loved!)**:
- Add domain → Auto-fetch DNS records
- Daily monitoring for DNS changes
- Alert on unauthorized changes
- Certificate expiration tracking
- Email alerts (30/14/7 days before expiry)
- Dashboard widget showing expiring items

**Technical Implementation**:
```typescript
// Daily cron job
async function monitorDomains() {
  const domains = await db.query('SELECT * FROM domains WHERE is_active = true');

  for (const domain of domains) {
    // Fetch current DNS records
    const currentRecords = await dns.resolve(domain.name);

    // Compare with stored records
    const changes = detectChanges(storedRecords, currentRecords);

    if (changes.length > 0) {
      // Alert admins!
      await sendAlert({
        type: 'dns_change_detected',
        domain: domain.name,
        changes: changes,
        severity: 'medium'
      });

      // Update audit log
      await auditLog.create({
        action: 'dns_changed',
        entity: 'domain',
        entityId: domain.id,
        changes: changes
      });
    }

    // Check certificate expiration
    const cert = await ssl.getCertificate(domain.name);
    if (cert.daysUntilExpiry < 30) {
      await sendAlert({
        type: 'certificate_expiring',
        domain: domain.name,
        daysRemaining: cert.daysUntilExpiry
      });
    }
  }
}
```

**Value**: Proactive monitoring prevents outages!

---

### **Phase 4: Ticketing System** (3-4 weeks)

**Entities**:
```sql
-- Tickets
tickets (
  id, organization_id, subject, details,
  status, priority, category,
  assigned_to, created_by,
  asset_id, billable_hours,
  created_at, resolved_at
)

-- Ticket replies
ticket_replies (
  id, ticket_id, reply_text, type,
  created_by, is_internal, created_at
)

-- Ticket attachments
ticket_attachments (
  id, ticket_id, file_name, file_path, uploaded_by
)

-- Linking
ticket_assets (ticket_id, asset_id)
ticket_users (ticket_id, user_id)
ticket_documents (ticket_id, document_id)
```

**Features**:
- Create tickets (by IT staff OR end users)
- Assign to IT staff
- Link to assets (auto-populate from user!)
- Status workflow
- Priority levels
- Internal notes (IT only) vs replies (user sees)
- Email notifications
- Time tracking (billable)
- Attach files
- Search tickets

**Helios Integration**:
```typescript
// When user creates ticket, auto-populate context!
const ticket = {
  created_by: currentUser.id,
  assigned_to: getITStaff()[0].id,

  // Auto-link user's assets!
  relatedAssets: await getAssetsForUser(currentUser.id),

  // Auto-include user context
  userInfo: {
    ou: currentUser.orgUnit,           // From Google Workspace
    groups: currentUser.groups,        // From Google Workspace
    manager: currentUser.manager,      // From Google Workspace
    recentLogins: currentUser.lastLogin
  }
};
```

**Client Portal**:
- Users submit tickets via portal
- View ticket status
- Reply to tickets
- View knowledge base
- **Same login as Helios main portal!**

---

### **Phase 5: Provider Access & External Support** (2-3 weeks)

**This is where your decentralized vision shines!**

**Use Cases**:

**A. Internal IT Supporting Internal Users**:
```
Internal IT Team (employees):
- Full access to all modules
- Manage users, assets, tickets
- Normal JWT authentication
- All features available
```

**B. Internal IT Supporting External Clients** (Your MSP features):
```
// Organization has BOTH internal users AND external clients

Organization: "ObiLabs MSP"
├── Internal Users (IT staff)
│   └── Manage both internal operations AND client support
├── External Clients (via separate module)
│   ├── Client A Portal
│   ├── Client B Portal
│   └── Each client has isolated data
```

**C. External Provider Supporting Internal Users** (Your API key vision!):
```
Organization: "Acme Corp"
- Internal IT team (small, 2 people)
- External MSP (ObiLabs) helping via API

ObiLabs has Vendor API Key:
{
  permissions: ["read:tickets", "write:tickets", "read:assets"],
  requiresActor: true
}

Every action by ObiLabs tech shows:
"John Smith from ObiLabs MSP resolved ticket T-456 for Acme Corp"
```

**Implementation**:
```sql
-- External provider access (already built!)
api_keys (type = 'vendor', vendor_config = {...})

-- Client management (for organizations supporting external clients)
external_clients (
  id, organization_id, client_name,
  is_active, billing_enabled
)

external_client_users (
  client_id, user_id, portal_access
)

external_client_tickets (
  client_id, ticket_id, billable
)
```

**Key Insight**: **You don't need separate apps!**

Use Helios's existing architecture:
- **Internal IT** → Full Helios access
- **External providers** → Vendor API keys (with actor attribution)
- **External clients** → Client portal module (data isolation via permissions)

---

## 💡 How to Avoid Over-Complication

### Your Concerns Addressed:

**1. "Internal staff vs external client data leakage"**

**Solution**: Permission-based data isolation (not separate apps)

```typescript
// All in one database, isolated by permissions

// IT Staff sees EVERYTHING
if (user.role === 'admin' || user.role === 'it_staff') {
  tickets = getAllTickets();
}

// External client user sees ONLY their organization's tickets
if (user.type === 'external_client') {
  tickets = getTickets({
    where: { external_client_id: user.external_client_id }
  });
}

// External provider (via API) sees what they're granted
if (request.apiKey.type === 'vendor') {
  tickets = getTickets({
    where: {
      id: IN(request.apiKey.permissions.allowedTickets)
    }
  });
}
```

**No separate apps needed - just permissions!**

**2. "MTP bringing multiple tenants together"**

**Solution**: Phase 3 (not now!)

Focus:
- Phase 1: Single-org ITSM (internal IT teams) ← THIS
- Phase 2: Client portal (support external clients)
- Phase 3: MTP (MSPs managing multiple single-orgs)

**Don't build multi-tenant yet!** Perfect the single-org experience first.

**3. "Unified Endpoint Management"**

**Solution**: Module for later (Phase 6)

```typescript
// UEM as optional module
entity.device_policy
entity.device_compliance
entity.device_application

// Integrates with:
- Google Workspace Mobile Management
- Microsoft Intune
- Jamf (for macOS)
```

**Don't build this until ITSM core is proven!**

## 🎯 Go-to-Market Strategy

### Positioning:

**Primary Message**:
> "Helios is the only IT management platform built natively for Google Workspace. Stop managing users in two places—Helios syncs your Google Workspace AND manages your IT operations in one beautiful dashboard."

**Secondary Messages**:
1. "Auto-discover assets from Google Workspace—no agents, no manual entry"
2. "Secure provider access with full audit trails—your data, your control"
3. "Modern, fast, and actually enjoyable to use"

### Target Customers (Beachhead Market):

**Primary**: Google Workspace organizations with 10-100 users
- Education institutions
- Tech startups
- Consulting firms
- Digital agencies
- Non-profits

**Why This Segment**:
- ✅ Use Google Workspace (your superpower!)
- ✅ Need ITSM but can't afford FreshService
- ✅ Don't have dedicated IT team (2-5 people max)
- ✅ Value modern tools
- ✅ Willing to pay for time savings

### Distribution:

**Phase 1**: Direct (Month 1-6)
- Google Workspace Marketplace listing
- Reddit (r/gsuite, r/msp)
- Product Hunt launch
- Content marketing (blog, tutorials)

**Phase 2**: Partner (Month 7-12)
- Partner with Google Workspace resellers
- MSP partnerships (use MTP tier)
- Referral program

**Phase 3**: Scale (Month 13+)
- Enterprise sales team
- Channel partners
- International expansion

## 📋 Immediate Next Steps (This Week)

### Option A: Finish Current Helios v1.0 (Recommended)
**Time**: 3-5 days
1. Complete API Keys UI (wizard, show-once modal)
2. Complete User Detail View
3. Polish existing features
4. Get to 100% on current scope
5. **Launch Helios Client Portal v1.0** to beta customers

**Why**: Ship what's 98% done, get users, get feedback

### Option B: Start ITSM Immediately
**Time**: Start now, but...
**Risk**: Helios v1.0 sits at 98% forever, never launches

**Why Not**: Finish what you started! Ship v1.0, then build ITSM with user feedback.

---

## 🎓 My Strategic Recommendation:

### **The Phased Approach** (De-Risk, Ship Often)

**This Week**:
- ✅ Finish API Keys UI
- ✅ Finish User Detail View
- ✅ Ship Helios v1.0 to 5-10 beta users

**Next 2 Weeks**:
- ✅ Get feedback from beta users
- ✅ Create OpenSpec proposal for "Add ITSM Module"
- ✅ Design ITSM database schema (adapt from ITFlow analysis)
- ✅ Write comprehensive specs for ITSM entities

**Month 2-3**:
- ✅ Build ITSM Core (Assets + Credentials + Documents)
- ✅ Test with existing beta users
- ✅ Iterate based on feedback

**Month 4**:
- ✅ Add Ticketing
- ✅ Add Domain tracking
- ✅ **Launch Helios Pro v2.0** publicly

**Month 5-6**:
- ✅ Scale to 100 customers
- ✅ Add advanced features based on user requests
- ✅ Prepare for MTP (if MSP demand exists)

---

## 🚀 Bottom Line:

**Build ITSM as integrated Helios modules.**

**Why**:
1. ✅ Leverage everything you've built (6 months of work!)
2. ✅ Unique market position (Google native ITSM)
3. ✅ Faster time-to-market (6 weeks vs 6 months)
4. ✅ Better UX (one login, one platform, zero sync)
5. ✅ Your API key system enables provider access perfectly
6. ✅ Clear product evolution (Client → Pro → Enterprise → MTP)
7. ✅ Can spin out later if needed (but won't need to!)

**Don't**:
- ❌ Overcomplicate with UEM now (wait for customer demand)
- ❌ Build multi-tenant yet (nail single-org first)
- ❌ Rebuild what exists (leverage Helios foundation)
- ❌ Try to beat ServiceNow (pick your battles - beat ITFlow!)

**Do**:
- ✅ Ship Helios v1.0 THIS WEEK
- ✅ Create ITSM OpenSpec proposal NEXT WEEK
- ✅ Build ITSM module MONTH 2-3
- ✅ Launch Helios Pro MONTH 4
- ✅ Scale to $100K ARR MONTH 12

**I'll lead the implementation. Just approve the direction and let's ship!** 🚀
